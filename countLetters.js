// Implement a function called countLetters.
// The function should take in a sentence (as a string) and then return a count of each of the letters in that sentence.
// For example, countLetters('LHL') should return results indicating that L appears twice, and H once.
// Before implementing this function, we need to think about how it will report back these counts.
// It's not that we want to know how many H's are in this sentence? because that would just be a number.
// We need it to report back multiple numbers.
// It could return an object where each unique character encountered is a property of the object and the value for that property/key should be the number of occurrences for that character.
// skip spaces.
// we shall use a for of loop to iterate through the string.
